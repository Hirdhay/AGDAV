        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The global shipping market has been significantly affected by the coronavirus epidemic and slowed shipments to and from China. Container-ship operators have canceled over 40 sailings previously set to arrive at the Port of Los Angeles between mid-February and April 1, 2020, resulting in a 25 percent drop in container volumes.4 Elsewhere, pileups and backlogs continue to build. While shippers and charterers may invoke force majeure clauses, such clauses are not available to certain owners who control their own vessels.Containership operators have already cancelled a significant number of sailings from China.</p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires growers and manufacturers under its jurisdiction to notify the agency of any expected supply disruptions. According to a statement issued by the agency, at least one drug is in short supply because of problems related to the coronavirus outbreak. However the FDA refused to disclose its name, the manufacturer or where the product or its ingredients are made, citing “confidential commercial information."India’s pharmaceutical industry expects supply issues relating to the coronavirus. The Trade Promotion Council of India estimates that 85 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients imported by India are from China, and notes that two-thirds of imports of bulk drugs and drug intermediates in 2018 and 2019 were from China.</p>

        <p class="sectiontag text-big">Construction</p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The global construction industry is bracing for slowing economic growth in the near term. Singapore, Canada and the US are already expecting supply chain interruptions with materials ranging from solar panels to electrical and plumbing fixtures to concrete boards and flooring tiles. Singapore is especially vulnerable because it depends on Chinese construction contractors to meet its significant labor needs. Delays in construction schedules for development projects can result in significant cost overruns.</p>
